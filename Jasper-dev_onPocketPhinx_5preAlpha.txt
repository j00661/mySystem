This is how I got Jasper working with PocketSphinx 5 pre-Alpha.

The following description is very short, only giving basic details based on a great deal of Googling. 
You cannot simply follow these instructions, but instead you need to check what you’re doing at each step. 
Good luck!

Note: this description starts with the master Jasper branch, then part way through it switches to Jasper-dev. 
It's just the way it went for me.

When running ./jasper.py, I got:

    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/download.py", line 25, in <module>
        from requests.compat import IncompleteRead
    ImportError: cannot import name IncompleteRead

I actually fixed this by doing:

    sudo easy_install --upgrade pip

    However, you should read this:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27341064/how-do-i-fix-importerror-cannot-import-name-incompleteread/27341847#27341847 
        ie. Beware that it’s not so simple, however I didn’t do the following recommended action: 
                apt-get remove python-pip.

Having fixed that ./Jasper.py then gave:

    File "/home/pi/jasper/jasper/client/mic.py", line 9, in <module>
        import pyaudio
    ImportError: No module named pyaudio

Which I fixed with:

    sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio

Having fixed that ./Jasper.py then gave:

    '/usr/local/share/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/en_US/hub4wsj_sc_8k' does not exist! 
    Please make sure that you have set the correct hmm_dir in your profile.

I found the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) here:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Archive/US%20English%20HUB4WSJ%20Acoustic%20Model/

Having downloaded and extracted the HMM:

    sudo mv hub4wsj_sc_8k /usr/local/share/pocketsphinx/modelhmm/en-us

Edit the file ~/.jasper/profile.yml, to contain the line:

    hmm_dir: '/usr/local/share/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/en_US/hub4wsj_sc_8k'

Having fixed that ./Jasper.py then gave:

    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hmm'

At this point I realised I needed jasper-dev, 
see https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client/issues/343

         "How to implement PocketSphinx 5prealpha in Jasper #343"
         “Jasper only supports PocketSphinx 0.8, but I think there is a fork working on implementing 5prealpha support.”
         "Pocketsphinx 5 prealpha support was added in commit f02a61e. It currently resides in the experimental jasper-dev branch."

Hence (with suitable backup etc - rpi-clone is great!):

    git clone -b jasper-dev --single-branch https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client.git

    cd jasper-client
    ./setup.py build
    sudo ./setup.py install

Having fixed that ./Jasper.py then gave:

    File "/home/pi/jasper/jasper-client/jasper/plugin.py", line 5, in <module>
        import mad
    ImportError: No module named mad

Fixing the ‘mad’ problem requires:

    sudo apt-get install mpg123
    sudo apt-get install mpg321
    sudo apt-get install python-pymad

At this point ./Jasper.py worked, however I very strongly suggest choosing a 4 syllable keyword, 
ie. Edit the file ~/.jasper/profile.yml, and add the line:

    keyword: 'Hello Jasper'

After this ./Jasper.py then behaved reasonably, though I suggest changing the plugins to have longer key phrases.
ie. see https://github.com/GeoBeBee/mySystem/blob/master/Jasper_keywords.txt

Happy to receive feedback, hope it works for you ;-)
