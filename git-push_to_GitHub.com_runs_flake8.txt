GitHub.com runs 'continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr â€” The Travis CI build' when you do 'git push'.

It's best to run this yourself before doing the 'git push'.

See https://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#

Install flake8:
    sudo pip install flake8 

Go to your jasper-client directory:
    cd ....myJasper.git/jasper-client 

Run the tests:
    flake8 setup.py jasper tests
    
If there are no errors then 'git push'! :-)
